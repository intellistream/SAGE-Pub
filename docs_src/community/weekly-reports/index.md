## 🔧 How It Works

Reports are generated by the [SAGE Work Report Generator](../../api-reference/sage-apps/work-report-generator.md):

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches commits and PRs from GitHub GraphQL API
2. **Aggregation**: Groups contributions by author with username normalization
3. **AI Analysis**: Uses LLM to generate summaries and leaderboard comments
4. **Visualization**: Creates ASCII bar charts for the leaderboard
